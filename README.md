# Smile LauncHer

A local-first Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Windows.

**Languages:** [English](README.md) · [Русский](README.ru.md) · [Deutsch](README.de.md)

SLH keeps Minecraft installations isolated, lets you manage accounts and Java locally, and downloads compatible content into the selected instance. It is built with Tauri, React, TypeScript, Rust and SQLite.

> **Status:** development release. Back up important worlds before trying a new build.

## Highlights

- Separate Minecraft instances with groups, grid/list views, logs, worlds, screenshots and per-instance settings.
- Vanilla, Fabric, Forge, NeoForge and Quilt.
- Microsoft, Ely.by and offline accounts.
- Modrinth browsing and verified installation; CurseForge support when configured.
- Managed Eclipse Temurin Java 8, 17, 21 and 25, plus detection of installed Java runtimes.
- English, Russian and German included by default; custom locale files are supported.
- Optional local sharing of selected files between instances, with explicit configuration and backups.
- No analytics or advertising. Launcher data stays on the local machine.

## Downloads

Get a build from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gareldd/slh/releases) and choose the matching Windows architecture.

| Package | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| `*-setup.exe` | You want the simplest guided installation. |
| `*.msi` | You need an MSI package for managed or manual deployment. |
| `portable/` | You want a self-contained folder. Extract the **entire** folder to a writable local drive, then run `SLH.exe`. |

Portable releases include a fixed WebView2 runtime archive. On first start, SLH extracts it automatically; the player does not need to download or install a browser component.

Release packages are intentionally empty: they do not contain accounts, instances, Java installations, worlds, logs or caches.

## Privacy and accounts

SLH stores launcher data locally. Microsoft login requires a configured Microsoft client ID; CurseForge availability depends on its configured access route or key. Never commit, upload or share `data/`: it can contain accounts, tokens, worlds and private server information.

## Build from source

Requirements for Windows development:

- Node.js and npm
- Rust with the MSVC toolchain
- Visual Studio Build Tools with **Desktop development with C++**
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime

```powershell
npm install
npm run tauri:dev
```

Checks:

```powershell
npm run build
npm test
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
```

Build instructions, including portable packages and installers, are in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) and [PORTABLE.md](PORTABLE.md).

> **Do not publish a personal `release/SLH-Portable` folder.** The portable build script deliberately preserves its `data/` directory so your development launcher keeps working. Create a clean release folder and verify that `data/` has no files before uploading it.

## Architecture

The UI is a React application displayed by WebView2. Rust/Tauri performs privileged work—files, SQLite, Java, Minecraft launching and network requests—through a typed IPC boundary. A development server may use `localhost`; published builds load their bundled interface locally and do not expose a public web server.
